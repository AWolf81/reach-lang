Verification says it can't prove TBalanceZero,
but no pay statements ever occur,
so how could the balance be anything but zero?

(Answer: while loop needs stronger invariant.
 How can we communicate this to the Reach programmer?)


Verification failed:
	in dishonest mode
	for RolePart (0,("A",LT_BT BT_Address))
	of theorem TBalanceZero
	from ../anti-examples/CE_LocalLimitation.rsh:13:10
	specifically: (= ctc_balance1 0 ):
