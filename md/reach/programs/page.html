  This document describes the structure and content of Reach ["XXX","defn","programs"], including
  their syntactic forms,
  the standard library,
  and the standards of valid programs.

<p>The rest of this section is structured according to the contexts of the different parts of a Reach program, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-valid"] describes what is meant by the term valid in Reach.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-module"] describes the top-level structure of a Reach module.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-appinit"] describes the structure of Reach application initialization.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-step"] describes the structure of Reach steps.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-local"] describes the structure of Reach local steps.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-consensus"] describes the structure of Reach consensus steps.</li>
  <li>["XXX","seclink","ref-programs-compute"] describes the common structure of Reach computations shared by all contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between the modes of a Reach application is shown by this diagram:</p>

<h2 id="ref-programs-valid-validity-and-other-concepts">{#ref-programs-valid} Validity and other concepts</h2>
<p>
  Reach imposes further restrictions on syntactically well-formed programs.
  These restrictions are described throughout this manual using the term ["XXX","defn","valid"] to refer to constructions that obey the restrictions,
  and the term ["XXX","defn","invalid"] to refer to constructions that do not obey them.
</p>
<p>
  It is always invalid to use a value with an operation for which it is undefined.
  For example, <code>1 + true</code> is invalid.
  In other words, Reach enforces a static type discipline.

<h3 id="security-levels-and-scope">Security levels and scope</h3>
<p>
  The text of a Reach program is public knowledge to all participants.
  However, any value that comes from an interaction expression is a ["XXX","defn","secret"] which only that participant knows.
  Furthermore, any values derived from secret values are also secret.
  A value, X, is considered derived from another, Y, if the value of Y is provided to a primitive operation to arrive at X, or if Y is used as part of a conditional that influences the definition of X.
  Secrets can only be made public by using the declassify primitive.
</p>
<p>
  When secret values are bound to an identifier
  within a local step,
  the identifier name MUST be prefixed by an underscore (<code>_</code>).
</p>
<p>
  When public values are bound to an identifier,
  regardless of context,
  the identifier name MUST NOT be prefixed by an underscore (<code>_</code>).
</p>
<p>
  Consequently, identifiers which appear inside of a
  function definition or arrow expression
  MAY be prefixed by an underscore.
  This will cause a compiler error if any value bound to that
  identifier is public.
</p>
<h3 id="domination">Domination</h3>
<p>
  A term Y is said to be "["XXX","defn","dominated"]" by a term X if all paths in the control-flow graph of the application from the root to Y pass through X.
  In most cases, this corresponds to "X appears above Y at the same or lower level of indentation" in the program source code.

<p>For example, in the following program:</p>
<pre class="snippet numbered"><ol class="snippet"><li value="1"><span style="color: #8250DF">f</span><span style="color: #24292F">();</span></li><li value="2"><span style="color: #CF222E">if</span><span style="color: #24292F"> ( </span><span style="color: #8250DF">p</span><span style="color: #24292F">() ) {</span></li><li value="3"><span style="color: #24292F"> </span><span style="color: #8250DF">g</span><span style="color: #24292F">();</span></li><li value="4"><span style="color: #24292F">} </span><span style="color: #CF222E">else</span><span style="color: #24292F"> {</span></li><li value="5"><span style="color: #24292F"> </span><span style="color: #8250DF">h</span><span style="color: #24292F">();</span></li><li value="6"><span style="color: #24292F">}</span></li><li value="7"><span style="color: #8250DF">m</span><span style="color: #24292F">();</span></li></ol></pre>
<p>
  <code>f</code> dominates <code>p</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>m</code>.
  But no other term dominates any other term.
  In particular, <code>g</code> does not dominate <code>m</code> because it is possible to reach <code>m</code> without going through <code>g</code>, such as when <code>p()</code> is false.
