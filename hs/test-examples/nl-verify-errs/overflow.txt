  Theorem formalization:
  v12

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v2" = 1
      (from: v2)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v12" = (<= v4 v11 )
      (from: v12)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v4, v11 ))
    "v11" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v11)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(UInt.max, 1 ))
    "v4" = v2
      (from: v4)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:11:7:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v2)
