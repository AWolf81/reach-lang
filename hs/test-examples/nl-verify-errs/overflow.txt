  Theorem formalization:
  v11

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v1" = 1
      (from: v1)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v11" = (<= v2 v10 )
      (from: v11)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v2, v10))
    "v10" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v10)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(UInt.max, 1))
    "v2" = v1
      (from: v2)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:11:6:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v1)
