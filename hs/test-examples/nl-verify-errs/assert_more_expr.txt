  Theorem formalization:
  v9

  This could be violated if...
    "v1" = 0
      (from: v1)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:8:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

      (from: v2)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:9:32:application)

  In context...
    "v9" = (= v7 v3 )

      (bound at: reach standard library:21:17:application)
      (because: evaluating PEQ(v7 , v3 ))
