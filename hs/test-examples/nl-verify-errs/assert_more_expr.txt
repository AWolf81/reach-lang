  Theorem formalization:
  v9

  This could be violated if...
    "v2" = 0
      (from: v2)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:8:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:9:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

  In context...
    "v9" = (= v8 v4 )
      (from: v9)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PEQ(v8, v4 ))
