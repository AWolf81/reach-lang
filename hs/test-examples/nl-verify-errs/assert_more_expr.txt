  Theorem formalization:

  This could be violated if...
    "v1" = 0
      (from: v1)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:8:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

  In context...
    "v6" = (= v4 v3 )

      (bound at: reach standard library:22:17:application)
      (because: evaluating PEQ(v4, v3))
