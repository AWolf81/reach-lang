  Theorem formalization:
  v14

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v2" = 1
      (from: v2)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v14" = (<= v5 v13 )
      (from: v14)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v5, v13 ))
    "v13" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v13)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(UInt.max, 1 ))
    "v5" = v2
      (from: v5)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:12:6:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v2)
