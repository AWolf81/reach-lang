  Theorem formalization:
  v13

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v1" = 1
      (from: v1)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v13" = (<= v3 v12 )
      (from: v13)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v3, v12))
    "v12" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v12)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(DLC_UInt_max, DLL_Int ./overflow_con.rsh:14:19:decimal 1))
    "v3" = v1
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:12:6:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v1)
