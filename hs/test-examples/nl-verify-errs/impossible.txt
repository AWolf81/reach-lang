Verifying knowledge assertions
Verifying for generic connector
  Verifying with mode = VM_Honest
Verification failed:

  Theorem formalization:
  v3

  This could be violated if...

  In context...
    "v3" = (< v2 0 )
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./impossible.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLT(v2, 0 ))
