 ./Err_Eval_IncompatibleStates.rsh:6:15:application

 6|       .timeout(1, () => {});

    Incompatible states:
The expected state of the program varies between branches because:
  * Expected a publication to have been made by this point.
  * The number of active participants vary between states:  vs "A". Ensure all needed participants have been set before the branch. Perhaps move the first `publish` of the missing participant before the branch?
